# Text_Summarization_BART

This project focuses on developing a text summarization system using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project specifically utilizes data collected from CNN News as the training dataset. CNN News provides a diverse range of news articles covering various topics, making it a suitable source for training a text summarization model.

The Hugging Face Transformers library offers a wide range of pre-trained models, including BERT, GPT, and BART, which are powerful architectures for natural language processing tasks. In this project, a specific model from the Hugging Face Transformers library will be chosen to train the text summarization system.

The project involves several key steps. Firstly, a substantial amount of data will be collected from CNN News, consisting of pairs of articles and their corresponding summaries. This dataset will be preprocessed and prepared for training.

Next, the chosen Hugging Face Transformers model will be fine-tuned using the prepared CNN News dataset. Fine-tuning involves training the model specifically for the text summarization task, allowing it to learn and generate accurate and concise summaries.

During the training process, the quality and effectiveness of the generated summaries will be evaluated using the ROUGE metric. ROUGE provides a comprehensive evaluation by measuring the n-gram overlap and other similarity measures between the generated summaries and the reference summaries. This evaluation metric allows us to assess the summarization system's performance and make improvements as needed.

Once the training and evaluation process is complete, the trained model can be utilized for text summarization on new articles. Given an input article, the model will generate a summary that captures the key points and essence of the original text.

By utilizing the Hugging Face Transformers library and the CNN News dataset, this project aims to develop a robust and effective text summarization system. The system will have the potential to summarize news articles accurately and efficiently, providing users with concise and informative summaries of the latest news and events.
